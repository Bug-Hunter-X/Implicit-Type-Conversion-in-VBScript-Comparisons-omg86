This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to implicit type conversion during comparisons. The script `bug.vbs` showcases a function that compares two values.  However, if these values are strings that can be interpreted as numbers, unexpected comparison outcomes may occur.  The solution file `bugSolution.vbs` explicitly converts the values to numbers before the comparison to ensure accurate results.
